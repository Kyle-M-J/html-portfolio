<hr>
<h3>Man of Steel</h3>
<p>I think this is one of the best representations of Clake Kent and Superman on the big screen.</p>
<h3>Captain America: The Winter Soldier</h3>
<p>This is the best Marvel Moive, it has all the best action, a great story, and overall great acting</p>
<h3>Dune</h3>
<p>This was a cinimatic masterpice. Amazing acting, compelling story, edge of your seat action and adventure.</p>
